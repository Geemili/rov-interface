To install the arduino driver, navigate into the `driver` folder and open
`driver.ino` with the Arduino IDE. Then select your serial port and upload the
Arduino.

To run the program, extract it, browse into the `dist` folder, and click on
`rov-interface.exe`. Make sure the controller is plugged into the computer before
running the program.

You will be brought to a screen where you can select the serial port that the ROV
is on.
