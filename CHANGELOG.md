Version 1.3
-----------

This version has a revamped text renderer and actually reads values from the
IMU. An attempt to fix the camera servo stutters was left unfinished, as the
stutters seemed to have resolved themselves.

- Enable BNO055's external crystal
- Improve text rendering so that compass values are easy to see
